This project contains different C# programs that solve five assignment questions from your course. Each program shows how to use important C# features like:
Immutable data (records)
Interfaces and sealed classes
Generic classes and collections
Handling errors with exceptions
Reading and writing files
Writing clear, modular code
The questions are about real-world examples like finance, healthcare, inventory, grading, and logging.

Make sure you have .NET installed version 5 or later.
Clone the repo to your computer.
Use a C# IDE or terminal to build and run the programs.
Look at each programâ€™s Main method to see how it works.
